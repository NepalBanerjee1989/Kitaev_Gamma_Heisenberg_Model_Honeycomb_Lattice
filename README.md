# Kitaev_Gamma_Heisenberg_Model_Honeycomb_Lattice
Here we have simulated Kitaev-Gamma-Heisenberg Model for simulating the 2D  VdW material Alpha-RuCl3 using classical Monte-Carlo.Here we have predicted transition temperature T=6.5K which is very close to experimental results reported on this material which is 7-8K.Here we also noticed the Classical Z2 spin liquid in pure kitaev limit.
Here we use the parameter J1=0.1(FM),J2=0,J3=-0.2 ,K=1.0(FM) ,Gamma=0.4(FM) and that predict zigzag AFM ground state for this material.We confirmed this with spin configuration and static spin-structure calculation.
Here we have used fortran 77 language and gfortran compiler for developing the project and use python for analysis the data.
We also simulated the Classical Z2 spin liquid using our simulation in pure kitaev limit where K=4.0,J=Gamma=0.
We notice a micro-vortex state from real space spin configuration and static spin structure factor calculation.
