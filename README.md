# Kitaev_Gamma_Heisenberg_Model_Honeycomb_Lattice
Here we have simulated the Kitaev-Gamma-Heisenberg Model for simulating the 2D  VdW material Alpha-RuCl3 using classical Monte-Carlo. Here we have predicted transition temperature T=6.5K, which is very close to experimental results reported on this material, which is 7-8K. Here, we also noticed the Classical Z2 spin liquid in the pure Kitaev limit.
Here, we use the parameter J1=0.1(FM), J2=0, J3=-0.2, K=1.0(FM), Gamma=0.4(FM), and that predicts a  zigzag AFM ground state for this material. We confirmed this with spin configuration and static spin-structure factor calculation.
Here we have used the Fortran 77 language and the gfortran compiler for developing the project, and used Python for analysing the data.
We also simulated the Classical Z2 spin liquid using our simulation in the pure Kitaev limit, where K=4.0, J=Gamma=0.
We notice a micro-vortex state from real space spin configuration and confirmed that an exotic phase of matter using the static spin structure factor calculation, which clearly revealed the existence of the classical Z2 spin liquid.
